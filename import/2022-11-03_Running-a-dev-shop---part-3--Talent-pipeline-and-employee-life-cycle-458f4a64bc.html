It feels like the supply and demand is getting worse every year and is even tricker in a new, fast-growing specialization, like the one you hopefully picked.</p><p name="386f" id="386f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, one has to pay reasonable salaries if one wants to make a profit on top of them. In this part of the blog post I will propose a solution to this conundrum.</p><h3 name="a83d" id="a83d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Mythical Señor developer</h3><p name="f3a8" id="f3a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Over the years I have struggled to hire great senior developers and engineers. It struck me that I found people with reasonable experience to be often underskilled, have high compensation expectations, but perform below par in dealing with day to day technical challenges.</p><p name="2920" id="2920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is clear to me now why that is the case. The best talent and experience is rare and they tend to have a preference to work with companies other than dev shops. The choice usually falls within one of two categories:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3313" id="3313" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Safety seekers</strong> usually prefer to go to big corporations like FAANG or banks, which offer generous benefit packages, high levels of security and low responsibility.</li><li name="fb20" id="fb20" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Adventure seekers,</strong> on the other hand, usually prefer startups, with high risk and high return on investment, in case of success, in the form of equity or similar.</li></ul><p name="06c9" id="06c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Oftentimes, aside from benefits, both can offer better base compensation.</p><p name="2824" id="2824" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is, typical software houses present little value to highly talented and experienced developers. While there exist interesting strategies to attract senior talent to a dev shop, my personal experience is that they hardly scale and the best way to build high-quality services is to focus on another group of developers — juniors. Regardless of which group you focus on — the best way to create a win-win situation is to hire talent and not experience.</p><blockquote name="95e5" id="95e5" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--hasDropCapModel graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">“Be a talent scout”</em></blockquote><blockquote name="77c7" id="77c7" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">— </em>Steve Jobs</blockquote><h3 name="6204" id="6204" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Hire for steep slope</h3><p name="aa94" id="aa94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I believe the primary goal of a highly specialized dev shop should be to find, grow and retain talent.

Young engineers are oftentimes attracted to new emerging technologies — it takes a small employer branding budget and a presence at local universities, to arouse their interest. <br><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">The senior developer, on the other hand, needs to first resign from his current specialization to join the new one, which is often perceived as a risk with an unclear potential reward.</em></li><li name="909e" id="909e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Speed of learning.</strong> Students and graduates are used to learning and getting into new stuff all the time, and so they are usually much more receptive to new technologies, as well as company methods and culture. <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Unfortunately, more experienced developers are used to incremental learning and oftentimes accumulated bad habits</em>.</li></ul><p name="1bc5" id="1bc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Most importantly, a good dev shop has a clear value proposition for Juniors. Good dev shop is a place where a junior engineer can:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d500" id="d500" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">kickstart his career</li><li name="a698" id="a698" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">learn and grow as fast as their abilities allow them to</li><li name="ebe1" id="ebe1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">aggregate skills that gonna pay off throughout her/his career</li><li name="b573" id="b573" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">experience and co-create a great engineering culture,</li></ul><p name="2d97" id="2d97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Many of the above things are hard to reproduce in a fast growing startup or a corporation led by non-engineering related goals and affairs.</p><p name="d83c" id="d83c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The alignment of interests between a dev shop and junior engineers makes it a win-win situation, where both sides benefit greatly from working together. Moreover, there is an even stronger, more profound alignment here at play.</p><blockquote name="ad2a" id="ad2a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Given that repeatable hiring of great, experienced engineers in a fast-growing market is often close to impossible - the rate of growth of such a dev shop depends mostly on the rate of growth of its less experienced employees.</blockquote><blockquote name="d988" id="d988" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Therefore it is in the employer&#39;s best interest to grow juniors into mids, mids into seniors and seniors into seasoned principal engineers and engineering managers.</strong></blockquote><p name="b4b3" id="b4b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">With multiple projects that a dev shop is working on — it is much easier to grow talent than inside a product company or corporation.</p><p name="d145" id="d145" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is by far the best value proposition a dev shop can offer to a software developer. And there is a great narration that should not be underestimated:</p><blockquote name="0b63" id="0b63" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">A great dev shop will be able to retain great talent for years and when an employee leaves, they should be able to find highly attractive positions as principal engineers, engineering managers, CTOs and founders.</em></blockquote><p name="6fc6" id="6fc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">That being said, hiring only unexperienced Juniors and neglecting mentoring is a bad idea. Hence again the need for a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">technical co-founder</strong> is fundamental to kickstart an engineering culture and every good experience you add to the mix can be potentially leveraged to grow faster. Yet again, the focus should be on potential, aka talent, aka ability to climb steep learning curves.</p><h3 name="7c74" id="7c74" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Talent pipeline and employee life cycle</h3><p name="f2f2" id="f2f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Now that I’ve hopefully convinced you that focusing on potential brings more benefits than focusing on experience, let’s look at what an employee’s journey could look like. Let’s start by reviewing the concept of the hiring pipeline (or as I prefer to call it — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the talent pipeline</strong>) and an employee lifecycle.</p><figure name="d77e" id="d77e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*3DVHTrPManEiA6S213vJOQ.jpeg" data-width="10416" data-height="5360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3DVHTrPManEiA6S213vJOQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="e61e" id="e61e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The talent consists of the following stages:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e890" id="e890" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Employer branding</strong> consists of activities aimed at building awareness of the company among potential employees and presenting it in a favorable light.</li><li name="3ac1" id="3ac1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Recruitment</strong> is the process of converting potential employees into actual employees, by cherry-picking talent from the pool built in the previous step.</li></ul><p name="ed8e" id="ed8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The employee pipeline continues through these stages:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="9b19" id="9b19" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Onboarding</strong> which includes (but is not limited to) training fresh employees in key technologies, skills, and other aspects of working in a company.</li><li name="667c" id="667c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Growing and retaining.</strong> A talent requires to be taken care of to grow to bring value.

A detailed description of some of these phases each deserves a post (or a book) on its own, therefore expect only cherry-picked aspects to be covered.</p><h3 name="ff3d" id="ff3d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Employer Branding</h3><p name="dd4a" id="dd4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As a starting dev shop owner, I thought that to hire a good engineer one needs to post a job ad and do a few interviews, and boom — done. Perhaps offering an attractive salary is a factor. Boy was I wrong — the journey starts much earlier.</p><figure name="bb45" id="bb45" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6Y109z0OdaCuLv8QwzQg0Q.jpeg" data-width="10416" data-height="5360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6Y109z0OdaCuLv8QwzQg0Q.jpeg"></figure><p name="859d" id="859d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A false impression might be strengthened by recruiting agencies, which will promise to deliver high-quality candidates for a fee.

This approach typically leads to a limited success in attracting great talent</em></p><p name="3be8" id="3be8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A company that cares about quality hires runs employer branding campaigns, which may include one of many ways to attract talent:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f79a" id="f79a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Dedicated events</strong> for technical university students (e.g. lectures, hackathons, parties).</li><li name="76fb" id="76fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Full-semester lectures </strong>or workshops (as a part of a program or extracurricular) at a partner university.</li><li name="8549" id="8549" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Technological events</strong> which serve as broader marketing events but can be promoted among students in dedicated ways like discounted tickets, free passes, etc. There is a wide variety of formats: meetups, hackathons, workshops, conferences.</li><li name="7adb" id="7adb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Social media activity </strong>can be leveraged for employer branding — especially all kinds of activity in technological communities: activity on thematic forums, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and similar.</li><li name="ed73" id="ed73" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Personal brand — </strong>strong presence in social media and building a strong personal brand of a founder is yet another strategy to consider</li></ul><p name="868d" id="868d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The list is far from exhaustive and there is plenty to choose from. A small company with limited resources should combine one, two, or perhaps three efforts at most — and consistently build a compound effect over time. For example, use your events to make your social media look like there is always the next interesting thing coming. Do one thing at a time, but always do something.</p><p name="c5de" id="c5de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Specialization</strong></p><p name="f6f4" id="f6f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, I don’t have to tell you that employer branding activities should heavily leverage specialization, sharing knowledge and explaining the technology via all the different channels is bringing value to the community, which in turn tends to attract promising engineers.</p><p name="b4d4" id="b4d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Be consistent</strong></p><p name="a8fc" id="a8fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the latter stage of my career, when I was bootstrapping Ethworks, I already understood the role of employer branding. In the very first week of the new company I gave a lecture at Warsaw University of Technology. In the very first months I started extracurricular workshops using Solidity.</p><p name="06b4" id="06b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We were able to hire with ease. We attracted several talented people in the first months of the company. Once saturated, we put hiring and branding on hold..</p><p name="9225" id="9225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After some time, we were ready to hire again, but somehow we couldn’t find any good people for several months in a row.</p><p name="38bf" id="38bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was frustrated with unsuccessful hiring. And then I slowly began to understand that without proper employer branding we lost the ability to attract talent.</p><p name="1ba1" id="1ba1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We decided to reignite our employer branding efforts with a bang. We started with a <a href="https://medium.com/truefieng/mystery-puzzle-solved-or-why-we-gave-away-7-eth-to-an-absolute-stranger-8f877272312d" data-href="https://medium.com/truefieng/mystery-puzzle-solved-or-why-we-gave-away-7-eth-to-an-absolute-stranger-8f877272312d" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">PR stunt</a>, followed by a series of meetups that led to a huge, over 1000-people online hackathon. We invited other blockchain companies from Warsaw, Ethereum Foundation, became a sponsor and we attracted $60k+ in prizes for <a href="https://0xhack.dev/" data-href="https://0xhack.dev/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">0xhack</em></a> hackathon.</p><p name="0bde" id="0bde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a great stride, took us several months of hard work, but paid off and kicked-off successful hiring for years to come.</p><p name="90d9" id="90d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a good lesson of consistency.</p><h3 name="15bc" id="15bc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Recruitment</h3><p name="274e" id="274e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It is important to have many more candidates than what you want to hire so that you can cherry-pick the best ones. You will need to engage technical recruiters, like the CTO, and senior developers. With their time being very valuable, you want to limit their exposure to unpromising candidates. To do so, make sure the recruitment process starts with screening.</p><figure name="856b" id="856b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mvNymO38P86rs_ijrV7F1A.jpeg" data-width="10416" data-height="5360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mvNymO38P86rs_ijrV7F1A.jpeg"></figure><p name="3776" id="3776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Screening</strong></p><p name="da5f" id="da5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Usually, screening means a call from a recruiter, who asks basic questions about the candidate’s motivation, availability, and expectations to verify there is a match. Proper screening allows for saving time on not-very serious candidates that openly declare a lack of availability or mismatching expectations. We discovered there is more you can do during that phase.</p><p name="9317" id="9317" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">We found out that throwing a simple technical question during the screening — an unusual practice — can reject around 50% of candidates at the screening stage, doing wonders to recruitment process efficiency. It saves many hours of technical interviews per hire.</em></p><p name="fdea" id="fdea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It also allows to screen more candidates and find talent that can be overlooked by other companies — people without a formal education, but highly motivated and smart self-learners.</p><p name="67d6" id="67d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Candidates that pass screening can move to the interview stage.</p><p name="1d47" id="1d47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Interview</strong></p><p name="c588" id="c588" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is an untold truth about interviews — all interviews are bad. The reason is that you have a very limited amount of time to assess a candidate and predict their performance over several years, which is a rather difficult task.</p><p name="5006" id="5006" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you make it long — you will lose too many resources (namely senior engineering and candidate time), if you make it short — it will provide a limited amount of data points for decision-making.</p><p name="f20d" id="f20d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no silver bullet, but I do believe there is a sweet spot.</p><p name="a992" id="a992" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In our experience, a two-hour interview, with one hour of fundamental algorithms/database problem solving and one hour of pair programming is the best I have seen so far.</p><p name="1227" id="1227" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good technical recruiter can do 2–3 interviews daily, or 1 without distracting his other activities too much. During such an interview, you can see if the candidate has basic programming knowledge, can write simple proper functions, think about edge cases, as well as see how they use the programming environment, write tests (usually the first time in their life on the interview), and construct a solution step-by-step.</p><p name="7b24" id="7b24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are hiring for a steep learning curve. Look for people who are fluent in solving basic problems, and test their limits with edge cases and annoying details. Pick one who can solve problems in time and enjoys doing it. If they can do it for common programming tasks, they can very well learn any other programming skills.</p><p name="bcb9" id="bcb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Speed</strong></p><p name="a0e7" id="a0e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The speed of the process is essential, a good candidate will get a job offer within 1–2 weeks after they start searching. Ideally, you can close the whole process for a candidate in under a week. A screening call a day or two after the application, an interview 1–2 days later and an offer 1–2 days after the interview.</p><p name="5560" id="5560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I found over and over again that there is no time for committees and a single good technical recruiter call is often as good an assessment as a complex process run by big brand companies. Make no mistake, you are not FAANG, you can’t afford a long multi-step process. Time is the most precious resource for you. Move fast and outpace the competition.</p><h3 name="4892" id="4892" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">On-boarding</h3><p name="bc14" id="bc14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Once hired — the next phase is on-boarding and the most important part of it — training.

Its program involved lectures, skills training, and coding workshops. Here is a raw program of a workshop.</p><p name="662a" id="662a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lectures:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ab2a" id="ab2a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Innovation cycles, decentralized philosophy, state of blockchain, DeFi</li><li name="9050" id="9050" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Javascript, solidity and blockchain basics</li><li name="3513" id="3513" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Security of smart contracts</li><li name="8ab5" id="8ab5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ethereum algorithms and data structures</li></ul><p name="09d8" id="09d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Skills:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="07e6" id="07e6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Pair programming DOJO — an exercise in pair programming and test-driven development, later workshops were run using TDD</li></ul><p name="8805" id="8805" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Coding workshops:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="415c" id="415c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Setting up the environment</li><li name="0df7" id="0df7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Building ERC20 token and simple decentralized exchange (Dex)</li><li name="d88a" id="d88a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Building user interface for the Dex in React</li></ul><p name="9eaf" id="9eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">After such a workshop a candidate had a basic fullstack knowledge about building DApps on Ethereum.</p><p name="433b" id="433b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I know what some of you are thinking. Can an inexperienced engineer comprehend so much in one week? Not only they can. Occasionally, they outperform “Senior developers” on the customer side in their very first week of work.</p><h3 name="81db" id="81db" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Growing and retaining</h3><p name="8221" id="8221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Bootcamp is a great way to kick-start a career in a dev shop, but is by far insufficient to grow talent and deliver high quality services to the customers. The next step is to establish a mentorship structure.</p><figure name="b7a8" id="b7a8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pXas6ZSr7F3pLHir6sRhBA.jpeg" data-width="10416" data-height="5360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pXas6ZSr7F3pLHir6sRhBA.jpeg"></figure><p name="e294" id="e294" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mentorship</strong><br>Each newcomer (and really each engineer) should have a mentor who oversees their day -to-day work and guides their personal growth. A mentor acts as a go-to person, whenever they have questions or encounter problems. In a company with good engineering cultures mentors work with mentees on a daily basis through daily code reviews and pair programming sessions.</p><p name="adde" id="adde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This not only allows mentees to grow faster, but also more experienced teammates to practice training and leadership skills. They are involved in the company’s growth and are appreciated for their skills, which in turn allows them to build great satisfaction and form lasting relationships.</p><p name="d360" id="d360" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being a mentor is one step away from being a leader, who can take responsibility for a specific project or module. This creates a smooth path from junior to the mentor and further to the leader.</p><p name="6634" id="6634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Human touch<br></strong>Different people, different talents, skills and ambition. We tend to assign people with the highest potential to work on smart contracts and infrastructure under the mentors’ supervision right away. Developers who needed more time to become fluent with a complex technological stack would start with the front-end or back-end code.</p><p name="7680" id="7680" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone would be expected to become to some extent a full-stack developer over time. But the timing would be different based on personal preferences and available project needs.</p><p name="03a8" id="03a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Growth path </strong><br>Most importantly, at Ethworks, we mapped out a clear path of development with sublevels within junior, mid and senior stages.</p><p name="9339" id="9339" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depending on performance, our engineers were expected to move to a higher sublevel every 3 or 6 months, where 6 months we would call “normal track” and every 3 months — “fast track”.</p><p name="7b1c" id="7b1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It acts as a transparent system of promotions, which small companies often lack. And sends out a clear message to the employees and candidates: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">learning is a big part of the job and you are going to be compensated for it</em>.</p><p name="79b0" id="79b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mentorship roles and leadership roles in a dev shop are somewhat dynamic, as the project structure changes. Therefore we had a long path with many sublevels, which was decoupled from mentorships and leadership roles and titles.</p><p name="9b3e" id="9b3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A mid developer can mentor junior developers and seniors can lead a small team. A good mid can lead a small project. One important note — the more value they bring to other teammates , the further up the path they travel.</p><p name="ca95" id="ca95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">One base requirement, however, for each promotion was to demonstrate ability to deliver working high-quality code</em>. Mentorship and leadership roles early on in the path would be an argument for fast-track, so as working on complex code.</p><p name="059b" id="059b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Compensation</strong></p><p name="104f" id="104f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Compensation is a tricky topic that needs to be navigated diligently. If you underpay your employees they might get demotivated and eventually leave the company. Overpaying will reduce your margins and paradoxically might be demotivating as well. Therefore observing market conditions and responding to market pressure is a key.</p><p name="65ec" id="65ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is an interesting observation around the market pressure on engineering salaries.</p><p name="f97c" id="f97c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relatively</em> low competition for engineers without experience. Then the first pressure on salaries usually shows up after two years of experience, when the market starts considering developers to be a “mid” level. After another two years, when the market starts considering developers to be “senior”, even more pressure shows up. And because all the recruiters enter similar search criteria on Linkedin it is almost in a single day, when an engineer suddenly becomes popular and his Linkedin inbox starts to swell. An approximation of a market value of an engineer is displayed on a chart below.</p><figure name="8856" id="8856" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*pcio9Dm-VCo4uvBF" data-width="1600" data-height="823" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pcio9Dm-VCo4uvBF"></figure><p name="a5fb" id="a5fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There might be a temptation to pay salaries that closely reflect the market value — that is to do a major raise after two years and after four years since starting a job. I find that approach to be suboptimal.</p><p name="83e9" id="83e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe it is better to do a series of small raises instead, so that:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3581" id="3581" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Employees feel they don’t need to worry about salaries, the company will take good care of them.</li><li name="151c" id="151c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">There is always a clear mid-term personal growth goal that is associated with a clear reward.</li><li name="c298" id="c298" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">They feel they are being paid fairly.</li></ul><p name="b074" id="b074" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">So a good path for a fast-growing developer could look somewhat like this:</p><figure name="48eb" id="48eb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Y6nau_CqDyqKtboi" data-width="1600" data-height="823" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Y6nau_CqDyqKtboi"></figure><h3 name="60ee" id="60ee" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Leaving</h3><p name="0c2b" id="0c2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">When they leave </strong><br>A good company should retain their employees as long as possible.

That could be running one’s own business or trying some other specialization.</p><p name="a8d0" id="a8d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When that happens, make sure you do what you can to make them stay. If that fails, wish them all the best, let them go and offer help further down the road (see the maintaining relationships section below).</p><p name="c310" id="c310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Improvements</strong></p><p name="5ddc" id="5ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If on the other hand, people leave due to internal conflicts, unsatisfactory compensation or similar reasons — it means you have to improve certain steps in your employee lifecycle. Don’t blame the employees — always seek feedback and look for ways to improve.</p><p name="609b" id="609b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes some mitigation can be done right away — e.g. a company can make an employee a new offer, however most of the time, it will be too late — and it is better to focus on future improvements which will benefit other employees.</p><p name="d3e2" id="d3e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">About those who stay</strong></p><p name="4f84" id="4f84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When key people leave — it is important to take care of the remaining team. People tend to be grumpy when long-time teammates leave. But here is an overlooked truth:</p><p name="10ff" id="10ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Every end is a new beginning.

It can be hard to stop once in progress, but a well-managed company can avoid them, by focusing on all the things I write about in this post:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0381" id="0381" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Building proper mentorship structure</li><li name="e8d3" id="e8d3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Growing people who stay and move into new mentorship and leadership roles</li><li name="7cf1" id="7cf1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Maintaining attractive salary and appreciate people’s growth</li><li name="adbd" id="adbd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Maintaining good relationships with people that left</li></ul><blockquote name="640e" id="640e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--li">But even if an exodus happens, remember, it is not the end of the world.

While it is a noble goal to minimize the amount of mishires, it is impossible to avoid them completely. When that happens it is important to recognize the problem: an underperforming employee or even worse — a toxic one. In those situations time is against you. Don’t wait, give feedback right away, set clear goals for improvement and if they are missed, fire such a person. This is the mistake I have made numerous times, hesitating to act.</p><p name="1c72" id="1c72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A toxic or underperforming person staying in the company can do a lot of damage and demotivate other employees. The longer they stay the more complex it becomes to fire them and more difficult to eventually let them go.</p><p name="8c85" id="8c85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you fire — be polite and honest at the same time: hash out the real reasons. And most importantly, wish them all the best, just because they were not the right match for your company — doesn’t mean that they won’t fit perfectly somewhere else.</p><h3 name="5296" id="5296" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Maintaining relationships</strong></h3><figure name="8833" id="8833" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jHhzLToKPJSR42e8YcC9-g.jpeg" data-width="10416" data-height="5360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jHhzLToKPJSR42e8YcC9-g.jpeg"></figure><p name="d41c" id="d41c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Some might say the employee lifecycle ends when people leave, but great synergies can be found by keeping those relationships in good shape afterwards, for several reasons:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="bd4f" id="bd4f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">People who are happy with their career in your company, will refer to it as a great place to work for others and do your employer branding work for you.</li><li name="b141" id="b141" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Some might even decide to rejoin your company after a while, as they might discover grass is not greener on the other side.</li><li name="9d3b" id="9d3b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Some of your ex-employees will become decision makers seeking to hire great engineers.
