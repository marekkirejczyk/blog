#### Validations are … everywhere
Data validations and sanitization are ubiquitous throughout all kinds of programming. From web to mobile, from back-end to front-end, and of course, in the blockchain space, where a single injection can carry devastating results.

#### 😬 Validations are broken
It is also an annoying topic at times. There are many sanitization libraries, and one could expect that topic is exhausted. However, if we look for a lib with a reasonable list of expectations, you might find nothing that fits the bill.

The solid validation lib should have the following properties:

- **Type safety** — sanitized data should automatically convert to a proper type (in TypeScript),
- **Reusability** — Ability to define validations once and use them in multiple places,
- **Composability** — ability to create new validations for complex types (i.e. objects and arrays) using previously defined validations,
- **Readable errors** — if a validation fails, it should provide a meaningful message for the user,
- **Customization** — the ability to easily create new completely custom validations,
- **Simple** — if it takes more than 15min to learn the lib and start using it, it is too complex,
- **Small** — our js project dependencies trees are already too big; we don't want to make it even bigger.

It would be a nice bonus if it had out-of-the-box support for our favorite technologies like Express.js and, of course, Ethereum.

And so we created Restless, a simple library for validations that can rise to the challange! Core `@restless/sanitizers` library takes only **37kb **unpacked and has **zero dependencies**. Purely functional — just the way you like it. But let's start from scratch.

#### 🛠️ Installation
Install core restless library to start using sanitizers and validation:


```
```text
yarn add @restless/sanitizers
```
```
#### A simple example
Let's start by casting a string to number, pretty straightforward:


```
cast('123', asNumber) // 123
```
If one tries to cast invalid number representation an error will be thrown:


```
cast('foo', asNumber) // TypeError
```
Error can be easily customized:


```
cast('foo', asNumber, 'My custom message')
```
#### 🪄 Magic: Type safety
Now let's assign result of a cast to variable of proper type, here is how it looks like in my Visual Studio Code:

![]
Now let's see what happens if I accidentally try to assign result to a wrong type:

![]
Compiler and IDE knows the assignment is wrong, because there is a type mismatch. The data is sanitized and type safe.

You can define complex sanitizers for arrays:


```typescript
const sanitizer = asArray(asNumber)
```
And objects:

```typescript
const sanitizer = asObject({ foo: asNumber, bar: asString })
```
Once defined they can be used anywhere in the codebase.

#### ⚙️ Creating a custom validator
Creating a custom validator is simple, here is an example function that checks if value provided is string is only capital letters:

```typescript
export const asCapitalString: Sanitizer<string> = (value, path) => 
 typeof value === 'string' && value.match(/[A-Z]/)
 ? Result.ok(value)
 : Result.error([{ path, expected: 'string' }])
```
#### 💸 Ethereum
For Ethereum support install `@restless/ethereum` package:


```
```text
yarn add @restless/ethereum
```
```
Now you can use additional sanitizers:


```
asEthAddress('0xA5fE...f213', ...)
asBigNumber('10000000000000', ...)
asHexBytes(...)
```text
asTransactionHash(...)
```
```
#### 🚄 Express.js
For Express.js support install `@restless/restless` package:


```bash
yarn add @restless/restless
```

You can now use a couple of new functions like`sanitize`, `asyncHandler` and `responseOf` which will make sure you are properly sanitizing your data and formulating responses. An example route could look like this:

```typescript
const app = express()
app.get('/:foo', asyncHandler(
 sanitize({
 foo: asNumber,
 body: asObject({
 bar: asNumber
 }),
 query: asObject({
 baz: asNumber
 })
 })
 (data) => responseOf(data)
))
```
The `sanitize` transforms the request into an object that matches a provided schema, `responseOf` formulates proper response with HTTP code and serialized JSON data. `asyncHandler` wraps it all into a middleware that can handle async functions and convert exceptions to proper HTTP responses.
