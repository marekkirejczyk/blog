There is a common wisdom among software companies what a well-managed software house is all about. We build our companies based on best practices, diligently described in books. And also based on insights that we exchange over a cup of coffee and during business lunches.

And so…

📗 We align our teams with [**V2MOMs**]
or **OKRs**.
📘 We hire managers, to make sure we can kick-off the project and stick to the budget. Oh, sorry I meant **Scrum Masters** and **Agile Coaches** (because we are all so agile now). Some are brave enough to go one step further with **Holocracy**.
📙 We hire product managers, who religiously (or not really) follow **Lean Startup **methodology, cause we are all product houses now.
📕 We use [predictable revenue]
dogma for sales. [Blitzscaling]
for scaling. [No rules]
for setting the rules.

And so on and so forth. There is always the next hot book from the next Silicon Valley hot-shot CEO.

> Here is a thing — we read the wrong books. We are not product companies, for which books are written for. Those are different animals and we are Software Houses.
#### What is the client buying anyway?
Now that we know what SHs are not, we can try to understand what they are.

> Some people say running a software house is not very different than running a plumbing company or general handyman services. You basically sell your employees’ time and you bill by the hour. It is no surprise that with lack of basic understanding what software services are about, it is hard to distinguish one mediocre Agile/Web/Mobile development company from another.
There is a surprising shortage of books on software service companies. In my search for a better SH mental model, I came across the book *“Managing The Professional Service”*.

I found this over-three-decade-old classic to be refreshingly accurate.

One of the first concepts it introduces is the reason why customer buys our services, which relates to three types of value.

3 types of works and 3 related values that customer are looking for:

- **Expertise **— the type of work that require most of all very bright people (**Brains) **
- **Experience — Gray hair** — type of work that require a lot of attention to cases and edge cases, lead by experienced people who can lead juniors — for customers who look
- **Efficiency — Procedure** — repetitive type of work, that can be codified and to some extend automated that provides your customer **, **that can be done by a small army of Juniors according to procedures, that need to be created and refined by experienced people

Book is making an example based on a law office. Reading about it was a moment of epiphany.

> Software Houses are more like a law company than a software product company.
The analogy is surpassingly deep, as in both:

- It takes years to learn
- Complex project require complex internal and external communication that is touching domain expertise
- Most importantly: the balance between three types (brains, gray hair and procedure) of work will have deep consequences mapping to company structure, processes, hiring and culture

Lawyer company often has 3 levels to map to 3 levels of work. (not to be confused with jrs, cause there are also team leaders principals, staff, ctos and vps).

3 levels of work map to 3 types of work.

Which would suggest structure of a SH should look something like that:

A single person can mentor no more than 2–3 people. There is no need for managers that are hard to bill for and often their value can be apparently controversial.

For bigger projects One can introduce a helping experts with no official

power… which fits perfectly to a scrum master or agile coach role.

3rd level and 2nd level people work not only on 1st level to teach them and review their work.

They work on increasing can abstraction level by building libraries and frameworks, that can be used to build competitive advantage or open-source that help market. But that is a topic for another post.

Your sales, marketing and HR can be much smaller, as your seniors participate in sales (by working with customer expectations, scoping etc), marketing (creating open-source, quality content, talking on conferences) hiring (talking on meetups), which in turn can be leveraged for scaling and making your margin higher.

If you assume that software development is highly repeatable and is mainly **Procedure** work, then it makes sense, to build your company around popular *good-software-house-practises*™. That paradoxically can be true for **majority of web and mobile work**, that with endless frameworks and repeatable patterns are becoming somewhat of a commodity. Sounds good right?

Not really. If you want to compete on **Procedure **work, there will be always bigger company, let’s call it WebMasters, that invested millions in processes and automation. They can easily drive your margin down. You probably want to provide unique value until you are able to invest money into building procedure.

If you are a talented engineer — one market worth considering is building sophisticated on leading/cutting/bleeding edge technologies. For those king of work you might want to consider looking at the law companies to look for inspiration for your structure.
