Well actually there is very funny paradox that TDD is both growing and shrinking in the same time.

It is growing because more and more developers and teams use TDD every year. I like to think that TDD is growing in a linear fashion.

Shrinking because the whole Agile/Start-up/Software space is growing even faster. I like to think that it is growing exponentially. So in comparison to the whole it is getting smaller.

I know some great teams doing TDD and they don’t stop in their effort to learn new devs and teams of this approach. But there is just so many to teach and it not so easy to teach.

By TDD I mean test first, Red-Green-Refactor and Schwaber’s cycle, not just automated test suite.
