Post is too long to reply in details.

In short:

1. By linear relationship I mean 2+2 should be twice as fast as say 2+2*2. But it is not. Because there are predictions, low level cache etc That changes this simple relation more complex one. Not sure what you’re after here.
2. Hash operation was inserting a new element each time into both array and hash. The intention was to include resizing operation in the benchmark as rarely you work on fix-sized collections.

…

Ech… It’s too long. Let’s take one issue and discuss it.

I deleted source as I was modifying one code benchmark to do another. It’s a shame. I agree that sharing code in the first place would be a good idea.
