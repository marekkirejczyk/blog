*Note: We recently changed the name from Universal Login to Unilogin (link to the announcement * [*here*](https://medium.com/universal-ethereum/universal-login-is-now-unilogin-eb4683efadfc) *).*

We are happy to announce Beta 4 with a new Web3 provider API.

A new API is straightforward to integrate; you can do it in 3 easy steps:

- **Install npm:**

<pre>yarn add @universal-login/provider</pre>
- **Import UniLogin**

<pre>import UniLoginProvider from '@universal-login/provider';</pre>
- **Configure existing web3:**

<pre>web3.setProvider(
 UniLoginProvider.createPicker(web3.currentProvider)
);</pre>That‚Äôs it. Done!

That is all you need to do to unleash all the wonders of UniLogin. When a user wants to interact with Ethereum for the first time, the dialog to pick UniLogin or MetaMask appears.

If the user picks MetaMask, the application works like it always did. If on the other hand, users pick UniLogin, the application guides her step by step into creating the account, including on-ramping.

If a user wants to make a transaction or interact with the blockchain, you will get a dialog that allows you to confirm and customize gas options.

On top of that, when the transaction is being mined a dialog is displayed, so that you don‚Äôt have to implement your own.

We implemented a small in-app wallet inside your application so that users don‚Äôt have to install anything or leave your application to have full control over his account.

You can add a UniLogin button. It allows the user to manage his account on demand. Adding the button is just one line in HTML:

<pre><button id="unilogin-button" /></pre>![](/images/posts/1*fndKhP71SzXdDcMiKb0v0Q.png)

- With UniLogin, using Ethereum dapps is easier than ever, with the user guided step by step without ever leaving your application.
- DApp development is faster than ever, as you can save time not having to build onboarding and top-up.

This is last the last beta. We are now focusing on stability and minor features and getting the first RC1 out later this month and onward to a first stable version in March!
