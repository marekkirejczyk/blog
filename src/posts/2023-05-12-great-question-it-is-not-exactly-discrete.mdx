Great question. It is not exactly discrete.

However because there are those market "standards". Most recruiters use the same tools (eg Linkedin search), and use similar criteria. Therefore if you have a linkedin account, you will start getting offers about 2 years after you start your first job. Quality of offers will suddenly improve after 4 years. That was my observation in few different companies

on different markets (RoR, js, solidity).

That being said - take it with a grain of salt.
