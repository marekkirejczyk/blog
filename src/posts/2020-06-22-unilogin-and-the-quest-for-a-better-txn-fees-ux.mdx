Transaction fees remain one of the main usability challenges for Ethereum and blockchains in general. There are a few different problems with them.

#### Problem 1: Fluctuations
Fluctuations gas prices make fees unpredictable. The chart below is just one illustration of how volatile gas prices can be.

#### Problem 2: Necessity of ETH
A user may want to move ERC20 tokens around but still needs ETH to do it. This can result in what the user perceives as a bizarre situation where, despite possessing significant assets, they get an ‚ÄúInsufficient funds‚Äù error message.

#### Problem 3: Fee calculations
The fee calculation model is somewhat complex, which leads to a bad user experience.

*Somewhat complex Metamask UI for managing transaction fees.*

Here is an interesting fact: in our interviews with dapp developers, many of them stated **they would gladly pay fees for their users, as long as they made money on their users‚Äô actions.**

People familiar with the topic can already see that trend in *Argent‚Äôs fair use gas policy*.

To fight fee related challenges with UniLogin, we are introducing two fee modes.

If the user has to pay their own fees, it is now possible to pay them with the ERC20 tokens already in their possession instead of ETH using meta-transactions. This means users not only don‚Äôt need to have ETH, they don‚Äôt have to even known what ETH is.

‚Ä¶and the full on-boarding flow with wallet creation using only DAI (with our favorite on-ramp provider [Ramp](http://ramp.network/) ):

*DAI only onboarding*

You can try this out with one of our partners: [GnosisSafe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) , [Kickback]
or [Jarvis](https://beta.jarvis.network/) .

If a dapp developer decides they want to cover user fees, the UX becomes even better. Just create a wallet and send transactions. No fee dialogs, no transaction speed widgets, no unnecessary UI bloat.

These new features are introduced in UniLogin Beta 4‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää0.6.0

Shoot us an email to *marek [at] universallogin.io* if you would like to test *fee-less* transactions on your application.

In the future, we envision our customers dynamically making decisions of whether to cover a user‚Äôs fee or not based on various inputs: transaction data, the state of network and reputation of the user.

As a bonus, we are happy to let you know that [Web3 Modal]
now supports UniLogin!
