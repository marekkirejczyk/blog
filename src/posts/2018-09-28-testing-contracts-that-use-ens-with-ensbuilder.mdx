> When it comes to testing contracts and functionality that uses [Ethereum Naming System](https://ens.domains/) (ENS), it is a bit tricky. It is difficult to test in isolation from ENS, and it is hard to stub ENS.
We stumble upon that challenge when working on [Universal Login SDK](https://github.com/EthWorks/ENSBuilder) .

To solve that problem we created a simple library called [ENSBuilder](https://github.com/ethworks) , which allows one to quickly set up and configure a standalone instance of ENS, on a local environment, in tests or on a test chain.

With ENSBuilder setup is as easy as a single method call:


```
const ensAddress = await builder.bootstrapWith('example', 'eth');
```
And you already have a copy of ENS, up and running, as well as two domains registered: 'ens' and 'example.ens'.

You can now register an address:


```
await builder.registerAddress('marek', 'example.eth', '0x‚Ä¶');
```
The builder uses [ethers.js]
as a contract abstraction. W [eb3js]
is also supported but will require you to pass a private key. We plan to add better web3js support if we see requests from people to do it. We would also happily accept PRs :)

Why Ethers.js you may ask?
We find ethers.js to be a stable, light, feature complete and production ready alternative to web3js. Therefore we are using it both for tests as well as application code.
