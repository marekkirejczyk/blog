Great article! One thing that I kind of worry about in this model is a tragedy of commons.

What happens if everybody votes in his/hers best self-interest and against the common good. E.g. to withdrawal money from the company, when the company needs cash to invest. How can we prevent it?

We are about to start a project in the area of company tokenisation. If youâ€™re up for discussion drop me an email: marek.kirejczyk(monkey)gmail.com
