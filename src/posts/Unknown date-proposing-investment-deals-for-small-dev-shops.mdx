We would like to propose a novel investment deal for small dev shop/software houses.

**Who are we?**

We are a small group of Angel investors including:

- founders that successfully exited SH in significant size multimillion-dollar acquisition deals
- scale-up founders looking for dev house services that would be interested in acqusition in the future

**What do we believe?**

We find ourselves in a new dev shop reality. Start-ups and scale-ups are more than ever keen to use external companies to build software and acquire specialized small, mid-sized, and big software shops. There is a very deep market for highly specialized services with great opportunities for attractive exits.

**What do we propose?**

Invest in a few to several dev shops that would love to capitalize on new market opportunities in the form of angel investments from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in relatively small shops (several to a dozen people) for a minority stake in the company.

**We provide know-how in how to build:**

- acquisition pipeline for talent, employer branding, training programs and produce high retention
- customer acquisition pipeline, including occasional access to top SV start-up’s and VCs
- competitive global marketing and sales strategy for a small to mid-size shop
- an acquisition-ready company with a proper legal, contractual and tax structure

**The type of shops we are interested in:**

- That want to highly specialise and focus on a single technology or vertical
- Want to grow to mid-size company (40–50ppl) or bigger
- Have a co-founder with strong technical background
- Ambition to strive to be the global market leader in their narrow specialization

**Specializations we are most interested in?**

- Blockchain — Ethereum
- Blockchain — Polkadot
- Rust
- Fullstack JavaScript/Typescript with narrow single backend and front-end specializations

**Other interesting specializations.**

- Other single blockchain speclisations (e.g. Avalanche, Algorand, R3, Solana, Nervos)
- DevOps
- Cloud infrastructure
- Deep AI/ML (e.g. vision and image recognition or language and text processing)

**Are you interested?**
