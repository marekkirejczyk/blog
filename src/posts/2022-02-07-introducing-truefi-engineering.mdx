Hi Builders!

It has been a while since [TrustToken acquired Ethworks](https://twitter.com/ethmarek/status/1438086869728825350) . At both Ethworks and TrustToken, we always care deeply about the blockchain dev community and try to contribute as much as possible.

These last months we spent on integrating and organizing teams working on the main Trustoken product — TrueFi. Now that our work in that space is mostly done, we are ready to rejoin the community.

**⚙️ TrueFi Engineering**

First of all, we will migrate the old Ethworks blog and twitter to the TrustToken Engineering blog. We will share our learnings and interact more often.

**🎉 Events**

And! We promise to start showing up at events more. I'll be traveling less than I used to in the old days so you will have a chance to meet more people from the team instead. The soonest opportunity will be at ETHDenver, where we organise [Valentine's party](https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1488892635796357122) .

**👨‍💻 Open Source Initiative**

Open-source projects and contributions were a particularly strong part of our game. These last months were pretty intense for us and we feel we neglected our duties. But we are happy to inform you that we are coming back, better and stronger than ever.

**🚀 useDApp**

Last year, we created [useDApp](https://usedapp.io/)  — a React based framework for creating DApps with Ethereum and other EVM based chains. We resumed work on useDApp a few weeks ago and we are about to deliver some great news to you. Stay tuned.

**🧇 Waffle**

![]
[Waffle]
is a popular framework for testing smart contracts. We neglected maintenance and didn't invest into building new features. The market has changed and expectations are different than at the time when we created the most recent version. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but we have great plans that we will share when we are ready. We will reignite the project. Be patient.

**🎁 Surprise **#IaC

We have been working on a new smart contract code as an infrastructure project, which we will reveal soon!

**👌 Best practices**

Over the last few months, as we were organising the TrueFi team, we worked on many good practices around delivery and security. We leveled up our game. I can't wait to share with you all the learnings.
